This project focuses on analyzing a real-world natural disaster dataset using Python libraries. 
An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was performed to clean and transform raw data. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted, and various graphs and visualizations were plotted using Python libraries to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to natural disasters.
